### What I learned

The trickiest part of this challenge for me was the image blended with the purple background. I ended up just using a div with the background property. I went with a blend-mode of multiply, but I'm not sure that was correct because the design looks a little different.

It wasn't so much the color of the image though that was tricky, but the size especially switching from mobile to desktop. For that I used flex-basis, but there's probably a better solution.

### Continued development

I need more practice working with images in resizable layouts.

I think I'm getting better at structuring my html and css to do more with less, although I should get more comfortable with BEM or some other system.
